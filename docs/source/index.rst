sinflow
=======

   ``sinflow`` is a Python implementation of the sliced iterative normalizing flow (SINF) algorithm
   for density estimation and sampling. The package has minimal dependencies, requiring only
   ``numpy`` and ``scipy``. The code is designed to be easy to use and flexible, with a focus on
   performance and scalability. The package is designed to be used in a similar way to ``scikit-learn``,
   with a simple and consistent API.
